            <li>Always reach your campsite before sunset. Sun sets here between 4.30-6pm, it’s much easier to set up an amazing campsite with the sun going down! At the time of picking up the vehicle we do quick 45 min orientation to make you comfortable with the equipments and how to set up the campsite.</li>
            <li>Travel light!</li>
            <li>Always drive carefully. All our cars are made with love & utmost care. We personally take care of them. We also care about you a lot more than those so please follow traffic and local road rules.</li>

            <li>Bring back your waste to the city where it can be treated properly. We want to keep the mountains as clean as possible please help us in doing so. We are the promoters of litter free and responsible tourism.</li>
            <li>In case you are going for a trek, carry only a backpack with essentials and change of clothes. In other words ‘the less you need, the more you know’</li>
            <li>Explore new places and campgrounds apart from the ones mentioned in your itinerary. Trust us there are many and also tell us about it. We are a sucker for a good travel story.</li>
