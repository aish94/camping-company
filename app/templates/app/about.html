            <p>Harsh has got this amazing Roof Top Tent on his SUV, it takes care of both, your travel as well as your stay. All you have to do is give him your dates and he chalks out your route allowing you to maximise on your time while arranging the best night stops. A must-do is a night halt or two at Black Bridge Resort where you will get to meet and interact with Lana. Another halt organised is at Sa-i-Mika Resort, you can spend the entire day in the cafe. The tent suffices just nicely to keep you warm and cozy. BBQ equipped - what more does one need?</p>

            <h2>Ira</h2>
            <p>We are 3 girls and this was our first camping trip. It was surprisingly easy! Harsh and Heena were very responsive and helpful with all he planning and with our questions. Meghalaya was so beautiful in all the crazy rain and thunder, and it’s definitely something I want to do again. Good car and thoughtful amenities. :D a must experience!</p>

            <h2>Varun</h2>
            <p>To experience closeness of nature and the freshness around you opting in for the car-roof-tent was our best choice. The comfort it provided throughout the journey was just so amazing. Thank You the company company for making the trip and our anniversary so memorable. The idea of Car-roof is just apt for people who are crazy for adventure and want to be always close to nature. And the best thing which I should mention is the super co-ordination of Mr. Harsh with us. His support and contacts helped us a lot. Cheers !! ***** Varun</p>

            <h2>Shamsul</h2>
            <p>I would say it was one of the finest office getway we have done. The hosts are fantastic people and their idea of life is quite amazing. Harsh's place is in my opinion the best way to explore North east India. I would advice everyone to come prepared to live on your own. Listen carefully to all key advice and lovely routes Harsh and Heena have to offer. People in Assam & Meghalaya are super friendly & generous, always ask for help and they will love to hang around with you and make life easier. Please do not litter!! Hope this is helpful.</p>

            <h2>Shantanu</h2>
            <p>It was one of the most memorable vacations of my life. Everything was just perfect, from the local tips that Harsh and Heena gave to car handling to a) how easy it was to set up the tent and b) how comfortable it was! The fact that our hosts were constantly checking on us when we were travelling was really re-assuring as it sometimes got confusing being out there in the wild! I would recommend following their itinerary tips rather than going for the obvious places and you will have a trip which you will remember for a lifetime!</p>

            <h2>Jui</h2>
            <p>If you like adventure and being close to the nature then go for this camping vacation with Harsh’s beast camping van with a exotic tent to sleep in. Harsh is an avid traveler and was best at his hosting tips throughout the trip. He knows the places to the T . He drew the whole iternary for me as per my preferences . The camping nights were super easy and sleek as a first timer and that’s what made the whole trip fun. One of my best experiences to cherish for life.</p>

            <h2>Hattie</h2>
            <p>We had the most amazing trip using Harsh's Mahindra Thar driving around Meghalaya. One of the most fun and different trips we have ever been on. Harsh met us before with the car and made sure we were comfortable with how everything, including setting up the tent, worked. He designed an itinerary for us around the best spots in Meghalaya which was perfect and we were able to be quite flexible with this when we wanted to stay somewhere longer. All the places recommended to stay were ideal for what we needed, with great food and very friendly people! Black Bridge Resort was our favourite. Harsh was helpful and quick to respond throughout the trip, which made us feel very relaxed. Definitely recommend - the best and most flexible way to see the North East!</p>

            <h2>Samir</h2>
            <p>We were looking for a unique experience to celebrate our silver jubilee wedding anniversary and we are so glad we came across Harsh & Heena's camping-co listing of overlanding experience on airbnb. We were thrilled to know about having this unique experience in India. Heena understood our occasion and provided couple of itinerary. All the camping grounds and meeting the hosts - sharing each other's journey - homely food - it was just perfect. Heena and Harsh were always reachable on any query/question/tip we needed even during our trip. While this was our first trip with camping-co's overlanding experience, it certainly won't be our last. Highly recommended for adventurous people.</p>

            <p>Fantastic, fun filled and unique experience. Don’t expect any lavishness, but expect a rustic, adventure filled experience. Really loved the experience. Partner resort shouod provide better toilet facilities, specially for ladies. Family really enjoyed the experience.</p>

            <p>Harsh and Heena are amazing host. They have great in proactive communications . It was our first time camping however they made sure we were quite comfortable breaking out comfort zone. Their itenary recommendations were great and were available on call/chat all through out our trip for support. Highly recommended even if it would be your first time.</p>

            <p>Harsh and Heena have started a wonderful venture of camping on wheels. We loved the whole experience. They also prepared a customised itenary for us which was very thoughtful. Would highly recommend this for backpackers.</p>
