        <h1>Know your hosts and travel buddies:</h1>

        <h2>Heena -</h2>
        <p>I’m 27 years old. In my former life before Camping Co, I was a working professional with an undergraduate degree in Math and a postgraduate in MBA. It’s a ridiculous combination. I assumed myself to be left-brained only to realize it’s a loose theorem which can’t be proven. I’m a sucker for moon rises and sunsets, you’ll always find me gasping with amazement at these times. I also believe nature is my biggest inspiration and teacher. I aspire to make people connect with nature after all only homo sapiens are charged with enormous responsibilities of protecting the ecosystem around us.</p>


        <h2>Harsh - </h2>
        <p>I’m an adventurer dedicated to all mountains and sea, an expert mountain biker and an intermediate kayaker I’ve always been an outdoorsy guy! I’m 28 years old and in my former life I was responsible for introducing Uber’s services in India and was hired to set up India operations. I aspire to bring a balance into modern life taking the time to rest and unplug from the daily hustle and to focus on ourselves, our relationships, and the wonder of nature.</p>
